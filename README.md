# suitesparse-sys

This crate provides bindings to the SuiteSparse library. By default it expects you to have SuiteSparse installed on your system.
It will try to find these, but if it fails, then you can manually set the `SUITESPARSE_LIBRARY_DIR` and `SUITESPARSE_INCLUDE_DIR` environment variables set to the appropriate paths.
E.g. on Ubuntu you might have:

```bash
export set SUITESPARSE_LIBRARY_DIR=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu 
export set SUITESPARSE_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/suitesparse 
cargo test
```

If you wish to build SuiteSparse from source, you can enable the `build_vendor` feature, which will build the SuiteSparse library from the `vendor` submodule in this repository (this is currently version v7.7.0 of SuiteSparse). If you wish to use the `build_vendor` feature, you will need to ensure you have all the required dependencies installed on your system corresponding to the libraries you wish to build (see list below).


The possible features are:

- `build_vendor`: Build the SuiteSparse library from source (currently version v7.7.0)
- `build_static_libraries`: Build the SuiteSparse library as static libraries
- `openmp`: Enable OpenMP support in the SuiteSparse library

Each library in the SuiteSparse library is a separate feature. The features are:

- `mongoose`: Bindings to the Mongoose library.
- `btf`: Bindings to the BTF library.
- `amd`: Bindings to the Approximate Minimum Degree library (AMD).
- `camd`: Bindings to the Constrained Approximate Minimum Degree library (CAMD).
- `ccolamd`: Bindings to the Constrained Column Approximate Minimum Degree library (CCOLAMD).
- `colamd`: Bindings to the Column Approximate Minimum Degree library (COLAMD).
- `cholmod`: Bindings to the Cholesky Modified library (CHOLMOD).
- `cxsparse`: Bindings to the CXSparse library.
- `ldl`: Bindings to the LDL library.
- `klu`: Bindings to the KLU library.
- `umfpack`: Bindings to the UMFPACK library.
- `paru`: Bindings to the ParU library.
- `rbio`: Bindings to the RBio library.
- `spqr`: Bindings to the SPQR library.
- `spex`: Bindings to the SPEx library.
- `graphblas`: Bindings to the GraphBLAS library.
- `lagraph`: Bindings to the LA-Graph library.

The default feature list is:

- [`klu`, `amd`, `colamd`, `btf`]
